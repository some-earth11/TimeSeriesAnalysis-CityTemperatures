This project contains in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and prediction using the LSTM model of a kaggle dataset regarding cities and their average temperatures over the years.

The EDA is done using popular python libraries like matplotlib, seaborn and plotly. Choropleth map animation has been added to provide a view of all years in a map of the world. Another dataset(iso_codes) was imported for visualization in the choropleth map.

PS: You will have to run the <b>JUPYTER NOTEBOOK</b> locally to see the choropleth animation and make sure you have all the required libraries.

The Project covers EDA for the entire world and then moves on to a region(Asia) and then to a country(India) and its cities.

It covers all basics and often goes in depth of visualization using pyhton, perfect for someone learning these libraries, do star and fork :)
